Abstract:

Project- A decentralized real time chat app using blockchain technology

Building a real-time chat application using blockchain involves using special tools and
technologies to create a secure and decentralized platform. Blockchain acts like a digital
ledger that records all the chat transactions. It ensures that the chat app is transparent, and
no one can change or delete messages without everyone's agreement.

To store chat messages safely, we use decentralized storage solutions that spread the data
across many computers. This makes it hard for anyone to tamper with or remove the
messages.

To make the chat happen in real-time, we use special protocols that allow direct
communication between users. This means messages can be sent and received instantly
without going through a central server.

To protect user accounts and transactions, we use tools like Metamask. These tools act as
digital wallets, making sure only authorized users can access the chat app and make secure
transactions.

By using these tools and technologies, we can create a chat app that is secure, transparent,
and gives users more control over their data. It's like having a chat platform that is safe and
fair for everyone
